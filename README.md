# About the project
The project helps to demonstrate the developer platform development knowledge, library usage and development patterns. I used some useful libraries like Volley for communicating with the API and Picasso for loading the images, i used the mvvm design pattern (without data binding) and room database to display hotel details.

**issues**
- i noticed that when i use my phone for development some images didnt load, but when i use an emulator the images load.
